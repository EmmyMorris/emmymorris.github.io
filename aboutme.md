### My story

Growing up as the youngest in a family of software developers, coding has always been a part of my life. Through dinner table conversations and HTML/CSS classes in high school, I realized I found my career calling early! At Turing, both building applications from scratch and inheriting code bases, I found my passion for creating great user experiences and writing clear and concise code. Iâ€™m excited to contribute to an agile and collaborative team, where I can apply my skills to deliver business results.
